# Privacy Policy for Unimute

## Introduction

Unimute is a simple utility application for Windows that allows users to control their microphone mute status and volume through the Xbox Game Bar. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have regarding your data.

## Information Collection and Use

### Microphone Access

Unimute requires permission to access your device's microphone. This access is used solely to:
- Toggle the mute status of your microphone
- Adjust your microphone volume

**We do not record, store, or transmit any audio captured by your microphone.**

### Data Storage

Unimute stores the following settings locally on your device:
- Mute status preference (`IsMuted`)
- Volume level settings (`Volume`)
- Input device selection (`InputMode`)

These settings are saved locally to remember your preferences between uses and are not transmitted to any external servers.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not:
- Collect personal information
- Share any information with third parties
- Transmit data over the internet
- Use analytics or tracking services

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information is protected by your device's own security measures. No data leaves your system.

## User Rights

As a user of Unimute, you have the right to:
- Grant or deny microphone permissions through Windows settings
- Change or reset your preferences within the app
- Uninstall the application, which will remove all locally stored settings
